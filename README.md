# Project Proposal


## Abstract

We seek to provide a useful and easy-to-use algorithm for common investors to construct a portfolio that considers both historical stock performance and short-term market sentiment signals. This algorithm selects stocks (and possibly their derivatives) from a selection specified by the user, and calculates the stocksâ€™ volatility and expected returns using both historical data and current market sentiment. With these adjusted expected returns and volatility, the algorithm produces an optimized portfolio based economic theories.
